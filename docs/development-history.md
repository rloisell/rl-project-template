# Development History

> **Template** — replace this intro with a brief description of the project.
> Record session-by-session development notes here to keep the root README
> focused on the product, not the build process.
>
> For detailed command history and decision logs, see `AI/WORKLOG.md`.
> For the feature backlog and completion status, see `AI/nextSteps.md`.
