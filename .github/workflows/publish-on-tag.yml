# .github/workflows/publish-on-tag.yml
#
# Creates a GitHub Release with auto-generated release notes whenever a semver
# tag (v*) is pushed.  Works in conjunction with build-and-push.yml which runs
# on the same trigger and builds/pushes the container images.
#
# Requires: no additional secrets — uses the built-in GITHUB_TOKEN.
