# Secrets Scan — Gitleaks
# Author: Ryan Loiselle | Template: rl-project-template | Date: 2026-02-28
#
# Scans the repository for leaked secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens, private keys)
# on every push and pull_request using Gitleaks.
#
# Gitleaks checks:
#   - The full git history on push (catches secrets in past commits)
#   - The PR diff on pull_request (fast, just-changed files)
#
# No secrets or tokens required — Gitleaks runs offline against the checked-out repo.
